The Odin Project : Landing Page Assignment
By Quamin Hua

This project demonstrates the collaborative use of HTML and CSS.
I applied flexbox techniques along with several other CSS tricks to style
a landing page designed by The Odin Project.

The mockup and theme of the page can be found in the 'public' directory.
